    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chinese style Puff pastry Pao with sweet soy chicken</p>
    <p>simple at home recipe to try, you can use any additional ingredients in your refrigerator!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (14-16 ounce) sheet puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>17 eggs, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon light soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour your work surface. Roll out puff pastry sheet into a 12x16-inch rectangle using a rolling pin, about ⅛ inch thin. Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet and fold over the edges to form a ½-inch wide crust.</li>
        <li>Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water to make an egg wash. Brush egg wash onto the puff pastry to help the sesame seeds and scallions adhere. Use a fork to poke holes all over the middle of the puff pastry. Score the inner edge of the crust with a paring knife.</li>
        <li>Bake puff pastry and eggs for an additional 6 to 10 minutes, depending on how runny or firm you like your yolks. Keep in mind, they will continue to cook a bit after you take them out of the oven.</li>
        <li>Mix soy sauce and chili oil, and drizzle evenly over the eggs. Top with the remaining scallions, cut into 6 pieces, and serve!</li>
    </ol>
